# Housing-Data-Analysis
Fiverr project for a client

## Summary

This work was done as a service to a client from Fiverr. It involved pulling, cleaning, & aggregating data from:

- Zillow Research website : "ZHVI All Homes Time Series" home sales data sorted by County.
- American Community Survey portion of the United States Census : Demographic information on the counties within the United States.
- United States Census : State government tax collections by county.

The larger purpose was to show if the government collects more/less taxes in certain years, is there an economic impact on housing prices in the United States.
The demographic data was useful to see whether different races / sexes are located in concentration in counties that show large decreases / increases in housing values.
